My code book 
This code book describes the variables, data structure, and processing steps used to create the tidy dataset "tidy_dataset.txt" from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

The script 'run_analysis.R' performs the following key steps:
1. Merges the training and test datasets.
2. Extracts only measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Replaces activity codes with descriptive activity names.
4. Renames variable names for clarity and consistency.
5. Creates a second tidy dataset with the average of each measurement for each subject and activity.

Each row in represents a unique Subject and Activity combination. The columns are:
1. Subject
o Description: Identifier for the person who performed the activity
o Type: Integer
o Range: 1 to 30
2. Activity
o Description: Activity performed
o Type: Categorical (Factor)
o Possible Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
3. Measurement Variables
o Description: The average of each mean() or std() measurement from the original dataset.
o Type: Numeric (continuous)
o Units: Normalized (unitless)
o Examples:
* TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX
* TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanY
* TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanZ
* TimeBodyAccelerometerStdX
* FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMeanX
Note: All measurement variable names have been cleaned for readability:
o Prefix "t" changed to "Time"
o Prefix "f" changed to "Frequency"
o Abbreviations expanded (e.g., "Acc" to "Accelerometer")
o "mean()" and "std()" renamed to "Mean" and "Std"
o Special characters like "()" and "-" were removed
File Output:
* Name: tidy_dataset.txt
